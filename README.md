## Working with Custom Elements

[Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/custom-elements.html) are a feature of modern browsers which allow you to modularise and install your JavaScript components into the browser itself in order to extend it in new and powerful ways. Custom Elements are HTML components which have their own self-contained markup, styling and behaviour.

For example, say we wanted to create an element that formatted a personâ€™s name

    <name-card first-name="John" last-name="Hardy"></name-card>

If the name-card tag was registered as a custom element component then the browser could be made to render it as

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>First Name</th>
        <th>Last Name</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>Hardy</td>
      <tr>
    </table>

Custom Elements are useful for defining reusable components such as buttons and dropdown menus but they are expressive enough that they could even constitute entire web pages.

Because they are registered with the browser itself, Custom Elements do not compete with existing libraries and frameworks. In fact they can be used to facilitate greater interoperability and code sharing between them. A custom element designed for, say, an Angular application could be reused in a React application. The work that went into developing the component in one framework could be reused without modification in another. This enables flexibility in web development and it also helps defeat the general tendency towards vendor and framework lock-in on the front-end.

You can think of Custom Elements as a sort of containerisation for web components. They have been designed to maximise flexibility and code reuse.
